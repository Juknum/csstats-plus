## Features

### Player Profile Page Enhancements

On the player profile page, CSStats Plus adds the following features:

Less cluttered ranks display:
- You can see previous Premier ranks by navigating through them with arrows.  
- Community Maps ranks are shown separately.
- You can click on any ranks to filter player's data by that rank type / maps in competitive mode.

Kill/Death and HLTV donuts charts:
- Improved visualization of both charts, making it easier to understand player performance.
- If a player has very high K/D or HLTV rating, the charts will turn orange to indicate irregular values.

Match history enhancements:  
- You can now click on a match to directly access the match page on CSStats.

Most played/success maps improvements:
- All data is shown rather than just top 5 maps.
- Maps are now displayed with their full names instead of filenames.
- Data is properly sorted
- Map icons are displayed next to map names for better visual identification.
- You can now see both amount of matches played/won and the corresponding percentages.

### Player Profile - Matches Tab Enhancements

The Matches tab on the player profile page has been enhanced with the following features:

- Competitive, Wingman and FACEIT ranks are now displayed using SVG images for better quality and scalability.
- Competitive and Wingman ranks now display the rank the player upped or downed to, instead of the final rank after the match.
- Map names are now displayed in full instead of using the map filenames, improving readability.
